# **hela_npcdoc** 

The `hela_npcdoc` script provides a fully automated, immersive medical system for RedM servers using NPC doctors. When no human medics are on duty, NPC doctors will take over and offer healing services to injured players. This ensures consistent medical coverage across all hours, improving roleplay continuity and server functionality.

## :wrench: Features:

* :health_worker: **Dynamic NPC Doctor Spawning**: Automatically spawns an NPC doctor at configured medical locations when no medic players are on duty.
* :speech_balloon: **Interactive Healing Prompt**: Players receive a prompt to be healed when near an NPC doctor.
* :dollar: **Customizable Medical Fees**: Configure healing costs to suit your economy or job framework.
* :hospital: **Fallback System**: Ensures injured players can always access treatment, maintaining server flow even during off-peak hours.
* :gear: **Framework Compatibility**: Built for VORP and can be adapted for other RedM frameworks with minimal changes.

Perfect for roleplay communities that want reliable, lore-friendly medical support without requiring 24/7 player medic coverage.
